I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Prof. FANG Yuguang](http://www.fang.ece.ufl.edu/). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, in 2023. I further pursued my Master of Science degree in Signal Processing at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, graduating in 2024. During my master’s studies, I was fortunate to be guided by [Prof. LIN Zhiping](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00141) and [Prof. HUA Guang](https://ghua-ac.github.io/). My research interests primarily revolve around AI security, model watermarking, and AIGC forensics. **I am particularly inclined to pursue research that offers ​intuitive insights​ and bridges theoretical advancements with practical applications.** You can contact me via email by **haonanan2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk** or **haonanan309@gmail.com**.
